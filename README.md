# ODESolver
JavaFx app that solves ordinary differential equations and visualise solutions.

### General
Application solves first-order ODE with Euler method and supports its forward and midpoint variants. 
To solve ODE it needs:
  - ODE in function f(t,x) form, 
  - compartment [a, b] over which the equation needs to be solved,
  - step size h,
  - initial condition x0.

Application puts solutions in form of t, x points into table and visualize them on t(x) scatter plot.
It supports saving calculated points in declared text file.

Application also have user friendly error handling.

### Demo
Below I present a video showing an example of using the application.
